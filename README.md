# Pomodoro Timer

This Python script implements a Pomodoro timer using the Tkinter library. It helps users manage their work and break intervals effectively.

## Features

- **Timer Mechanism**: The script implements the Pomodoro technique, alternating between work sessions and break intervals.
- **Customizable Settings**: Users can adjust the duration of work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks according to their preferences.
- **Visual Feedback**: The timer provides visual feedback through color changes and checkmarks to indicate progress.
- **Sound Alerts**: Optional sound alerts are played at the end of each work session to signal the start of a break.

## How It Works

The script performs the following functions:

1. **Timer Reset**: Users can reset the timer to its initial state, clearing any ongoing countdowns and resetting the work and break intervals.
2. **Timer Mechanism**: The script implements the Pomodoro technique, alternating between work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks. Each interval has a predefined duration.
3. **Countdown Mechanism**: The timer displays the remaining time for each interval in minutes and seconds, updating dynamically.
4. **Sound Alerts**: Optional sound alerts can be played at the end of each work session to signal the start of a break. The sound file path can be customized.

## Usage

1. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
2. The timer will start with a default work session duration of 25 minutes.
3. Click the "Start" button to begin the timer. The timer will alternate between work sessions and breaks according to the Pomodoro technique.
4. Click the "Reset" button to stop the timer and reset it to its initial state.

## Customization

You can customize the following aspects of the timer:

- **Work Session Duration**: Adjust the duration of work sessions by modifying the `WORK_MIN` constant.
- **Short Break Duration**: Adjust the duration of short breaks by modifying the `SHORT_BREAK_MIN` constant.
- **Long Break Duration**: Adjust the duration of long breaks by modifying the `LONG_BREAK_MIN` constant.
- **Sound Alert**: Customize the sound alert played at the end of each work session by specifying the file path in the `count_down` function.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. The script utilizes the Tkinter library, which is included in the standard Python library.
